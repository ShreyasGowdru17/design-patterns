## ðŸš— Problem: **Payment Gateway Adapter**

You are asked to design a system that allows **different third-party payment gateways** to work with your e-commerce platform using the **Adapter Pattern**.

### Background

* Your system expects all payment services to implement the following interface:

```java
interface PaymentProcessor {
    boolean pay(double amount);
}
```

* However, third-party gateways have **different incompatible APIs**:

  * `PayPalService` exposes `doPayment(double amt)`.
  * `StripeService` exposes `makeCharge(double money)`.
  * `CryptoService` exposes `transferFunds(double value)`.

Your task is to **implement Adapters** so that all services can be used interchangeably in your system.

---

### Function Signature

```java
class PaymentProcessor {
    boolean pay(double amount);
}
```

---

### Input Format

* A list of transactions `[service, amount]` where `service âˆˆ {"paypal", "stripe", "crypto"}`.
* Each transaction should be processed via the correct Adapter.

---

### Output Format

* Return a list of `true/false` indicating whether each payment succeeded.

---

### Example

#### Input

```
transactions = [
  ["paypal", 120.50],
  ["stripe", 250.00],
  ["crypto", 999.99],
  ["paypal", 75.25]
]
```

#### Output

```
[true, true, true, true]
```

---

### Constraints

* `1 <= transactions.length <= 1000`
* `0.01 <= amount <= 1000000`
* Assume all payments succeed (return `true`).

/*
 * Adapter patterns comes under structural pattern as it deals with how classes are interacting.
 * As name suggests adapter pattern is used adapt two different incompatible system.
 *
 * Adapter pattern also helps and be connector between your system and some third party or legacy system.
 * For example your system expects data in one format to process and third party sends in one format.
 * Example : Consider you have to invoke some third party soap service which is xml base however your system is built on JSON
 * with some advanced fields at that time you create JSON-to-XML adapter which will help to interact with thirdparty.
 * Adapter pattern can be achieved in two ways :
 * 1. Class Level: class level mean to adapt something you are extending and doing inheritance of that class.
 * 2. Object level : Object level mean you keep has-a relationship with class rather doing tight coupling in system.
 *
 * One of the example is we know java supports both array and list to store data. Now you have legacy system
 * which is using array and you want to use collection functionalities to do so we have to convert, so Arrays.asList work as adaper
 * between array to list and then use collections.
 *
 * A java.io.InputStreamReader translates a byte stream into a character stream, and a java.io.OutputStreamWriter translates a character stream into a byte stream. These classes exemplify the Adapter pattern.
 * In particular, they change input/output stream interfaces to the required reader/writer interfaces
 * https://cecs.wright.edu/~tkprasad/courses/ceg860/paper/node26.html
 *
 * In this example we will see that Swiggy is selling food products now suddenly lockdown arise
 * and they thought to provide service of delivering grocery items for sometime so they write adapter which
 * helps them to convert similar to food item without touching their food delivery business.
